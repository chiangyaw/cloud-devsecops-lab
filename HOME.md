# Cloud DevSecOps for Terraform with Prisma Cloud Hands on Lab
## Prisma Cloud by Palo Alto Networks

### Introduction
In this workshop, you’ll learn how to leverage infrastructure as code (IaC) and DevSecOps to automate, scale, and improve the security posture of your cloud infrastructure. We’ll create a pipeline that provides frequent, easy-to-digest improvements to ensure our configurations are secure and compliant from the build-time to runtime.
Using Prisma Cloud, VS Code, GitHub, Terraform Cloud, and AWS, we’ll get hands-on experience implementing an automated Terraform security and compliance workflow.
